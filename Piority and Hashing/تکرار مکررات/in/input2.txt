Monday finds you like a bomb It's been left ticking there too long You're bleeding Some days there's nothing left to learn From the point of no return You're leaving Hey hey I saved the world today Everybody's happy now The bad things gone away And everybody's happy now The good thing's here to stay Please let it stay There's a millions mouths to feed But I've got everything I need I'm breathing And there hurting thing inside But I've got everything to hide I'm grieving Hey hey I saved the world today Everybody's happy now The bad things gone away And everybody happy now The good thing's here to stay Please let it stay Doo doo doo doo doo the good thing Hey hey I saved the world today Everybody's happy now The bad things gone away And everybody happy now The good thing's here to stay Please let it stay Everybody's happy now
